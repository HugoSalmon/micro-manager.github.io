The Micro-Manager image pipeline is designed to allow programmers to
provide code to analyze images as they are acquired.

To take advantage of this, you will need to write a class (in a Java
Micro-Manager plugin or Beanshell script) that overrides the "analyze"
method in the
[org.micromanager.api.TaggedImageAnalyzer](https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager/tree/svn-mirror/mmstudio/src/org/micromanager/api/TaggedImageAnalyzer.java)
abstract class.

The analyze method takes a TaggedImage as it arrives from acquisition.
Each
[TaggedImage](https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager/tree/svn-mirror/MMCoreJ_wrap/TaggedImage.java)
consists of raw pixels (either an array of bytes or shorts, depending on
the pixel bit depth) and a JSON Object of Metadata.

In a plugin or script you can provide your class derived from
TaggedImageAnalyzer to the acquisition engine:

```
acq.addImageProcessor(TestTaggedImageAnalyzer.class);
```

It will then analyze the images as soon as they are available, before
sending them to be saved and displayed.
